## PERSONAL EDIT OF SKYHUD

A TF2 Head's Up Display, inspired by many other existing huds, and focused on simplicity.

## Installation
Download the HUD .zip file and extract the main file (named "skyhud-master") into your TF2 custom folder in the following file path: steam/steamapps/common/teamfortress2/tf/custom
Also make sure that skyhud is the only hud present in the custom folder, otherwise you might experience issues and even game crashes.
