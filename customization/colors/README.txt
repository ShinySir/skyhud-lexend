Using the file "sh_colors.res", you can change the colors of various HUD elements such as the health and ammo numbers.
Using RGBA (red, green, blue, alpha) code, change the color of the specified element as you like.
The use and meaning of (almost) every color entry is commented.
Keep in mind that for most colors, the alpha value should always be 255, or you might end up with translucent health numbers, for example.
